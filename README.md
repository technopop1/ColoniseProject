# ColoniseProject

I will be developing my previous project, i.e. a RTS (Real Time Strategy) game, which will be based on the development of civilization. The player will have to recruit new inhabitants, collect resources for development, as well as troops that will defend the city from enemy invasions or attack the enemy base. The enemy will work in the same way as in Empire Earth / Age of Empire, Fortress or They Are Billions games, i.e. it will be either an artificial intelligence that develops its civilization itself and reacts to the player as if it were its enemy, or the opponent will appear from time to time heading towards the city to destroy it. The goal of the game will be to achieve a certain level of development of our civilization, optionally you will be able to win by completely destroying enemy colonies.
